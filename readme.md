Find a Way (astar pathfinding)
==============================

Migrating some of my older projects over to my github account.  This is an astar pathfinding demo.  The pathfinding logic implementation has been completely seperated from the interface so it can theoretically be used with no adjustment in other projects. Could do with a bit of recoding.
